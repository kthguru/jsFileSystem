JavaScript FileSystem API
==========

This is a JavaScript implementation of the [FileSystem](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/) API. It emulates the functionality be using _IndexedDB_ and _LocalStorage_ (whichever is available).

Code is written in Coffeescript.
Some special extensions are used so Coffeescript -> JavaScript translation can only be done by the ```coffee.py``` Python script.
